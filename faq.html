                <p id="bodyParagraph">

                    <b>Q: Where do you hunt?  </b><br />
                    We have thousands of  acres of prime deer and elk habitat behind
                    locked gates. We know the hundreds of thousand acres of public land as well as any one can. <br />
                    <b>Q: What type of rifle should I be using for elk/deer and how far should I be able to shoot?</b><br />
                    They type of firearm you need is based on the animal you intend to hunt. <br />
                    <b>Q: Can I send you my ammo and gun before I come on the hunt? </b> <br />
                    We can accept your Firearm and store it safely before your hunt. We also have select calibers of rifle on hand that can be rented for a fee. <br />
                    <b>Q: What if I wound an animal?</b><br />
                    When we wound animals during our hunt, we do our best to track and find the animal. It Is important to use the proper caliber ammunition for the animal you intend to kill. To high caliber ammunition and you will kill the animal but ruin meat. To low caliber ammunition and you risk injuring the animal and losing it. <br />
                    <b>Q: What should I do with my meat?</b><br />
                    We recommend bringing meat bags to bring your meat home with you. Once you have it home you may contact a local butcher for processing.  If you do not want to keep the meat you can donate it to local charities or through <a href=”https://www.h4hungry.org/ target="_blank"/> Hunters 4 the Hungry</a><br />
                    <b>Q: What is the altitude and terrain we will be hunting?</b><br />
                    The altitude of the Book Cliffs is 6,600 ft. The terrain is remote, rocky, and difficult to traverse. <br />
                    <b>Q: What do I need to do to get in shape so that I will have the most successful hunt possible? </b><br />
                    Being in good physical condition on a rigorous hunt is important. Make sure you get cleared by a physician for long hikes in rough terrain, with unpredictable elements.  Getting regular exercise and eating healthy food can ensure that you have stamina for the hunt. <br />
